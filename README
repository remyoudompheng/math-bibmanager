Mathkaba
A bibliography manager for mathematicians.

This program is aimed at managing a collection of mathematical articles.
To use it, you should have a hierarchy of directories containing
.zb files with a copy of a ZentralBlatt entry (in ASCII format).

You should have PDF of DjVu files along with the .zb files: if GTK 2.14
or later is available, standard mechanisms will be used to select
an appropriate viewer, if not, xdg-open will be used, if available.

By calling
  mathkaba -d <path>
Mathkaba will explore the directory <path> in search of bibliography
entries and display them as a list. It also displays a tree representing
all MSC (Mathematical Subject Classification) tags appearing in the
.zb files, and allows selective display of articles matching a given
classification.

Dependencies:

 * GTKMM 2.12 or later

 * GVFS to be able to open URIs
