mathbib
A bibliography manager for mathematicians.

This program is aimed at managing a collection of mathematical articles.
To use it, you should have a hierarchy of directories containing
.zb files with a copy of a ZentralBlatt entry (in ASCII format).

By calling
  mathbib -d <path>
mathbib will explore the directory <path> in search of bibliography
entries and display them as a list. It also displays a tree representing
all MSC (Mathematical Subject Classification) tags appearing in the
.zb files, and allows selective display of articles matching a given
classification.
